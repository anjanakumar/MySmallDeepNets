# MySmallDeepNets
This repository contains codes for deep learning techniques such as Restricted Boltzmann Machines, Autoencoder, Denoising Autoencoder, Feed Forward Neural Networks, Convolutional Neural Network, RNN, LSTM, and many others. 

I've started to uploaded my codes to this repro and it is ongoing process. Hopefully, I'll add all my codes for the above mentioned technqiues in the coming weeks. 

Please let me know if you have any questions.
